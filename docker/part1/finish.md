Great! You have complited the first part of the Docker course!

Let's summarize what we learned!

- We discovered the difference between containers and images. Containers and images are two different concepts and are the foundamentals of Docker. An image is a static element. A container is a dynamic element, more containers can be created from the same image.
- We studied the architecture of Docker: Docker client, Docker deamon, Docker registry.
- We learned to use some basic commands like: docker build, docker run, docker rm, docker images.
- We learned how to create a custom image with a Dockerfile. We also saw some basic and useful commands to use in Dockerfiles.
- We started creating our inference app and we dockerize it. This app will be expanded in the next steps where you will learn other importants Docker concepts.
