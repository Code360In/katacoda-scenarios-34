## Step 1 - Create new repository and initialize a project
In this step we will create a new repository in the **version_control_course** bitbucket project available [here](https://bitbucket.springlab.enel.com/projects/ITDSVER) 

##### Prerequisites
* You must have an Enel account and be able to access the Springlab environment.
* You must have the right permission level to create a new repository in the **version_control_course_project**

##### Create new Repository
First of all we need a new remote repository. Such repository will host our team code.


Go to [version_control_course](https://bitbucket.springlab.enel.com/projects/ITDSVER) project on Springlab and create a new repository using the "Create Repository" button at top right corner.
