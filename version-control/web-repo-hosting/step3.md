## Step 3 - Git Workflow
In this step:
* you'll learn what's a git workflow is
* you'll focus on **feature branch** workflow
* you'll create your first feature branch

##### Prerequisites
* You must have an Enel account and be able to access the Springlab environment.
* You must have a partner. (*Collaboration* is the key! :-))
* All this task must be executed with only one account. (let's say pair programming style!)
