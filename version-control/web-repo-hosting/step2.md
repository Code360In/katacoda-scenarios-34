## Step 1 - Create new repository and initialize a project
In this step:
* we will clone locally an existing remote repository in the **version_control_course** bitbucket project available [here](https://bitbucket.springlab.enel.com/projects/ITDSVER) 
* we'll create a new project locally
* we'll sync our local repository with the remote one

##### Prerequisites
* You must have an Enel account and be able to access the Springlab environment.
* You must have a partner. (*Collaboration* is the key! :-))

##### Clone an existing repository
Your collegaues started a new project few months ago and now want you as developer because they have an huge amount of work.

The address of the existing repository is: https://bitbucket.springlab.enel.com/projects/ITDSVER/repos/default/browse

In order to clone this repo you must have a *.git address*.
To obtain such address please navigate through your browser to the link above e click on the clone button:

Switch to *HTTP* protocol and copy the link in your clipboard.
