#### Jumping between versions

We have done a big walk through the basic git capabilities, and now it is time to use it for what it is, a version control system
from which we expect to be able to check out any past version of the project.

In fact, what we aim for is the ability to put to populate the work tree with the content of any stored commit.
Such an action is called _checking out a version_ and is accomplished by the command ``git checkout``. In its basic form, 
this command requires you to specify the id of the commit you want to checkout.

For instance, pick up the id second to last commit:

```bash
git log


```


```bash
git checkout 
```
