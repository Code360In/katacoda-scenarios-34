Here ends this walk through the fundamentals of git. 

Congratulations! You will put in practice what you have learnt pretty soon.

We have covered the basis of git to a deeper level than what is usually done.
At this point, if you are keen to revise the main topics or interested in knowing more,
 you can check the following references.

Some additional resources, sorted by complexity: 
 
- [Katacoda official git course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git). A simple but less comprehensive course than the present one. 
It could be useful for a quick refresh of the material covered.

- [Git objects](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects). This is the paragraph is part of a chapter about
 the internals of git of the book [ProGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). We strongly recommend to use it as a reference.
