# Working with Remotes

Collaborating with others on any project requires a way to share work among colleagues.
In Git this is done through remote repositories. These are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.

Users generally have permissions to:
- **read** work made by others fetching and pulling from remotes
- **write** changes to project pushing and merging to remotes

Managing remote repositories involves:
- **adding** remote repositories
- **removing** remotes that are no longer valid
- managing **remote branches** and define them as being tracked or not

Remote repositories can be on a **local** machine, in this case remote repository and working directory must be in **separated paths**

In this scenario we will first configure the environment with a local remote.
Then we will simulate simple operations that can happen when working on a remote repository with other people.
