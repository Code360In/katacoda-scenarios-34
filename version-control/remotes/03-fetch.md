### Step 2 - Git Fetch

`git fetch` command downloads changes from the remote repository into a separate branch named remotes/<remote-name>/<remote-branch-name>. This branch can be accessed using git checkout.
`git fetch` allows reviewing the changes without affecting your current branch.

#### Task

Changes have been made in the origin repository. 
Use `git fetch` to download the changes,  and then checkout the branch to view them.

Protip
You can view a list of all the remote branches using the command git branch -r
