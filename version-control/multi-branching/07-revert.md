As a commit history grows, you might realize that not all those changes are worth keeping, and select only some of them to be kept in the main development line.

With `git cherry-pick` we saw how individual commits can be relocated from one branch to another.

Another way to manage individual commits to reshape the history of the repository is deleting them: the command for this is `git revert <commit>`.
As with `git cherry-pick`, `<commit>` is the commit identifier, and can be a range of commits.

The default behaviour when running `git revert` from terminal is opening a text editor to edit the commit message, and create a new commit (which reverts the changes introduced by the ones targeted by the command). This behaviour can be modified with the options `--no-edit`, to keep the default commit message, and `-n` to prevent the changes from being committed.

*Note that using `git revert` on a commit, does not remove it from the history: it introduces a second commit that reverts the changes introduced by the first one. This allows the whole history to be traced back, and also allows to reintroduced changes that might be reverted by mistake â€“ simply using `git revert` again targeting a revert commit.*

## Exercise

**Remeber the model.py file? We cherry-picked those commits from the `installation` branch.**
**Now, let's switch to `installation` and undo those commits using `git revert`.**
