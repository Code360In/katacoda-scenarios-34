# Relocating branches

As the commit history of your project grows, it tends to get messier as well. Git has, however, a way to make it cleaner.  

---

Beyond `git merge`, Git offers another way of integrating changes from one branch into another: `git rebase`.

If you run `git rebase <upstream_branch> <branch>`, Git will undo all changes applied to <branch> and not yet merged in <upstream_branch>, and reapply them on the tip of <upstream_branch>. Effectively, this "relocates" a branch from its position to the tip of <upstream_branch>. At this point, the two branches can be merged through a simple fast-forward merge.  

Specifying <branch> is optional: if you don't, the currently checked-out branch will be used for it. On the other hand, if the changes should be applied to a branch different than <upstream_branch>, this can be specified with the `--onto` option: `git rebase --onto <target_branch> <upstream_branch> <branch>` will take all commits differentiating <branch> from <upstream_branch>, and transplant them on the tip of <target_branch>.

### The risk of rebasing...SERVE???

While useful, rebasing branches can lead to ambiguities. When rebasing commits in one branch are deleted and reapplied on another branch; if the former branch is then extended, and merged back to the latter, commits might be...

### Rebase or merge?

Either `merge` and `rebase` have their own pros and cons, and should be used accordingly.  
When using `merge`, the commit history is preserved and can be traced back, allowing developers to identify where and when ALL changes happened â€“ even those that were subequently reverted or discarded: this can result in a rather convoluted history.  
On the other hand, `rebase` rewrites the branching structure of the repository, resulting in a cleaner, more readable history. However, rebasing branches can lead to ambiguities especially when multiple contributors work on
