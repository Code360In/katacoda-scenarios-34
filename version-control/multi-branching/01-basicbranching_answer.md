#### Solution

A branch named "user_manual" can be created with  
`git branch user_manual`{{execute}}

If we inspect branches now, we will see a list of the existing branches in our repo ("master" and "user_manual"), with an **asterisk (*)** next to the one we're on at the moment.  
`git branch`{{execute}}
