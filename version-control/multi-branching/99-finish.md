Well done! You completed the tutorial on branching in Git!  

If you want to go deeper in the topics we talked about today, I always recommend the [Git official documentation][1], which includes the excellent [Pro Git book][2] and a number of video tutorials; and the [Atlassian Git tutorial][3].  
In addition, GitHub hosts a number of [resources][4] for Git (as well as for GitHub itself).
