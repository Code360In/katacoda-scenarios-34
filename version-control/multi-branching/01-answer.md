# Solution

A branch named "user_manual" can be created with:  
`git branch user_manual`{{execute}}

If we run `git branch`{{execute}} now, it will list the two existing branches in our repo ("master" and "user_manual"), and tell us that we're on the master branch by placing an **asterisk (*)** next to it.
