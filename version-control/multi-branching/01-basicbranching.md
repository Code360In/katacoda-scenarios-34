### Creating and inspecting branches: `git branch`

You are working on a new project, so you created a repository and already made a couple of commits to it.

*Remember you can always inspect them with `git log`*

Now you want to expand the project, by adding multiple branches to the repository.

The first and most important command to know is `git branch`.

Without passing any argument, it will list the current branches of the repo, and tell you which one you're on.

A new branch can be simply created by passing the new branch name to `git branch`

### Excercise:

We need a new branch, to work on the user manual for our software.  
*Try creating a new branch named "user_guide".*
